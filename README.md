# 📚 Indic OCR Service

A Python-based **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) service** tailored for Indic scripts and multilingual text extraction from images. This project provides a REST-style API to run OCR on local images or via HTTP requests using configured text engines.

It’s designed for easy deployment of OCR capabilities — ideal for integrating Indic OCR into web apps, mobile backend services, or batch processing systems.
